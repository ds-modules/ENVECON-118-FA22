    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this exercise were used in Ebonya Washington's paper: \"Female Socialization: How Daughters Affect Their Legislator Fathers' Voting on Women's Issues.\"  published in the American Economic Review in 2008. The paper asks whether having daughters influences the voting behavior of members of the US Congress. The hypothesis is that having (more) daughters makes legislators more likely to vote liberally (in terms of political alignment, and in contrast to conservatively) on issues concerning women.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we will focus on votes that took place in the 108th Congress, which held session in 2003/04. As a measure of a liberal voting record, we use scores assigned by the American Association of University Women (AAUW), a liberal group that concerns itself with issues of interest to women. For the 108th Congress, the AAUW selected 9 pieces of legislation in the areas of education, equality and reproductive rights. The AAUW then assigned a score to each member of Congress. The scores range from 0 to 100 and measure the percentage of times the legislator voted in favor of the position held by the AAUW.\n",
    "\n",
    " The dataset `legislators.dta` contains the following characteristics for a random sample of 386 members of the 108th Congress:\n",
    " \n",
    " * $ngirls$ number of daughters\n",
    " * $totchi$ total number of children\n",
    " * $age$ age\n",
    " * $female$ indicator for being female\n",
    " * $repub$ indicator for being a Republican\n",
    " * $moredef$ proportion of people in the legislator's district who are in favor of \"more spending on defense\" \n",
    " * $aauw$ AAUW score\n",
    " \n",
    "(For the purposes of this exercise, you can assume all members of the 108th Congress were either Democrats or Republicans and were either male or female.) "
