    "There is a large literature in macroeconomics that investigates why there exist such large differences in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita between developed and developing countries. Recently economists have focused on the role of agriculture in accounting for these differences (Restuccia et al. 2008, _Journal of Monetary Economics_). Why might agriculture be important? Consider two facts, which we will explore in greater detail below. First, labor productivity in agriculture for the richest countries is 78 times that of the poorest countries. Second, the poorest countries allocate 86% of their employment to this sector, as compared to only 4% in the richest countries."
