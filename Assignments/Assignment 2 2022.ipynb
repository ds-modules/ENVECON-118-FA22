    "# Exercise 1: Do Microfinance Loans Affect Expenditure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the world's poor have limited access to formal credit. Traditionally, they have had to resort to their social networks (family, friends) or local moneylenders that charge exorbitant interest rates (upwardsof 100%). This often prevents individuals from making investments in potential businesses or productive assets. In the last 15 years, microfinance institutions (MFI) have emerged all across the developing world to address this problem. The basic model of a microfinance institution (such as the Grameen Bank) is to provide small loans to a group of potential borrowers at much lower interest rates. The number of very poor families with a microloan has grown exponentially: from 7.6 million in 1997 to 137.5 million in 2010. Micro-credit has been heralded as a major advance in the reduction of global poverty. However, in recent years, critiques have emerged accusing micro-finance institutions of acting irresponsibly by holding the poor to very strict repayment schedules and charging unreasonably high interest rates. So where does this leave us? Does micro-credit help or hinder? In the January 2015 issue of the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, six papers evaluating the merits of micro-credit were released. We will explore the results from one of these papers by Augsburg et al., which evaluates a microfinance institution in Bosnia and Herzegovina."

    "## Data Description\n",
    "The data for this exercise comes from a study conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina investigating the effects of a small loan on access to liquidity, self-employment, income, labor supply, expenditure, and savings. These were individual-liability loans with monthly repayments and an interest rate of 22%. The sample consists of potential borrowers (who were just marginally eligible for loans). Approximately half the sample was randomly selected to receive the loan (the treatment group), while the other half did not receive anything (control group). You have a subsample of individuals (both in the treatment and control group) that the researchers used for their analysis. The respondent (= the loan applicant) answered questions about the household they belonged to as well as about their loand and personal outcomes (no two respondents are from the same household). The PS2_MFI.dta file includes the following variables (along with some others we will not ask you to analyze):"
