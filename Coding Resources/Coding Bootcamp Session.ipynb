    "The internet is your best friend. While we will introduce you to some R commands during section, you may find that there are times where you are having trouble with a function's syntax or need a new function to perform a certain task. Asking Google, using the [R Documentation site](https://www.rdocumentation.org/) as well as [R Project Package Reference Manuals/Vignettes](https://cran.r-project.org/) for help with functions and syntax will get you quite far. If something is unclear, searching for the R task and perusing answers on [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/) can be a helpful resource. I will try my best to make sure homework assignments mention the functions/packages needed for a new task, and that we've at least seen them in section or lecture. "
